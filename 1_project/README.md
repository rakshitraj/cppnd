# OpenStreetMap Route Planning Project

In this project, we will find a path between two points using [A* Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) in C++, just as you might see in a desktop or mobile mapping application. In this implemetation we will use real map data from the [OpenStreetMap project](https://www.openstreetmap.org/). 

The OpenStreetMap project is an open-source, collaborative endeavor to create free, user-generated maps of every part of the world. These maps are similar to the maps you might use in Google Maps or the Apple Maps app on your phone, but they are completely generated by individuals who volunteer to perform ground surveys of their local environment.
